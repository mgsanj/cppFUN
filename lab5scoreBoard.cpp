/*
Write a program to display the results of a contestant's performance on the score board. The results includes the scores given by the judges, the highest score, the lowest score, and the average score.

The program template has been partially written. You need to complete the code for the functions according to the document blocks above the functions.

In your main function, use an array for the scores from 7 judges . Then call the functions and display the contestant's outcome.

For 7 judges, when running on this Zybooks page, the outcome should be exactly as follows.

Judge #0 7.100000
Judge #1 4.500000
Judge #2 7.000000
Judge #3 3.800000
Judge #4 3.700000
Judge #5 2.400000
Judge #6 9.300000
Highest score: 9.300000
Lowest score: 2.400000
Average score: 5.400000

//* Get scores from the judges. When this function is

//* giving of scores using a random number generator. The scores must be
//* in the range 0.0 to 10.0. (Hint: This can be accomplished by
//* generating random integers between 0 and 100. )
//*
//* Parameters
//*   scores - Identify the scores array passed to the function.
//*   num - Identify the number of scores to be filled.
//*
//* Returns
//*   At the return, the array is filled with scores from the judges.

//* Format the scores from the judges. When this function is
