//* Get scores from the judges. When this function is
//* called for a contestant, it receives an array to be filled with
//* the scores from the judges. The function simulates the
//* giving of scores using a random number generator. The scores must be
//* in the range 0.0 to 10.0. (Hint: This can be accomplished by
//* generating random integers between 0 and 100. )
//*
//* Parameters
//*   scores - Identify the scores array passed to the function.
//*   num - Identify the number of scores to be filled.
//*
//* Returns
//*   At the return, the array is filled with scores from the judges.

//***********************************************************************
//* Get highest score from the judges. When this function is
//* called for a contestant, it receives an array that has been
//* filled with the scores from the judges.
//*
//* Parameters
//*   scores - Identify the scores array passed to the function.
//*   num - Identify the number of scores stored in the array.
//*
//* Returns
//*   The highest score stored in the array is returned.

//***********************************************************************
//* Get lowest score from the judges. When this function is
//* called for a contestant, it receives an array that has been
//* filled with the scores from the judges.
//*
//* Parameters
//*   scores - Identify the scores array passed to the function.

//* Get the average score from the judges. When this function is

//* filled with the scores from the judges.
//*
//* Parameters
//*   scores - Identify the scores array passed to the function.

//***********************************************************************
//* Format the scores from the judges. When this function is
//* called for a contestant, it receives an array that has been
//* filled with the scores from the judges. The function creates a
//* string that includes the scores, the highest score, the lowest score,
//* and the average score given by the judges.
//* The to_string function is used to convert from double to string.
//*
//* Parameters
//*   scores - Identify the scores array passed to the function.
//*   num - Identify the number of scores stored in the array.
//*
//* Returns
//*   The formatted string is returned.
